# Solid-Test-App

## Test assignment:

* Install Flutter
* Create a test application
* The application should: display the text "Hey there" in the middle of the screen and after tapping anywhere on the screen, a background color should be changed to a randomly generated color (should be able to generate 16777216 colors using RGB). You can also add any other feature to the app - that adds bonus points
* Please do not use any external libraries for color generation
* Push code to a GitHub
* Send the link to a GitHub repository back
